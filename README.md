# _Calmhand's Weather App_

**_Created by Johnny (calmhand)._**
_This project is part of a personal desire to learn Javascript, frameworks, and web development as a whole._

**This is a simple weather app that takes cities, zip codes, etc and retrieves local weather data from an API.**

This app uses [WeatherAPI.com's](WeatherAPI.com) API technology.

## Problems

The most trouble I had was using manipulating CSS both with javascript and manually. I feel like there many CSS basics I wish to learn.

For example, I wanted to make the site somewhat responsive on mobile devices and while it is usable, there are visible errors that a user can point out.

Another CSS complication I had was using animations/transitions and learning their differences. Most of the site uses transitions.

Overall, I like how the site turned out; I just wish it was a little more refined.
